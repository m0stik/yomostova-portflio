<h1><strong>How To Find Apartments In Vancouver Painlessly: 5 Tips</strong></h1>
<p>Even if you are new to Vancouver I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ve heard dozens of stories about all this real estate crisis in the city. Frankly speaking, it&rsquo;s kind of difficult, time-consuming and stressful to find a nice apartment in any metropolis of the world. But several insider&rsquo;s tips can help you successfully cope with the challenge and truly have your &ldquo;quiet enjoyment&rdquo; as promised by BC rental contract.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Time Frame</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Most of apartments becomes available for rent at the beginning of the month. As a result, it&rsquo;s reasonable to start search <u>a month or two prior to your desired moving-in date</u>. For example, we wanted to move to another apartment on February 1st. So, we started our &ldquo;hunt&rdquo; (looking for options, arranging viewings and filling up applications) on January 2<sup>nd</sup>. Until January 13-15, the best and the most affordable apartments had been already rented like hotcakes. That&rsquo;s how it works.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t lose precious time &ndash; start search earlier, arrange viewings and <u>visit as many options as you can</u>.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>Where To Look</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>We&rsquo;ve found our apartment on <u>Craiglist.com</u> as have done many our friends. Also you can try these <u>common resources</u>:</p>

</ul>
<p>But there is another interesting thing about Vancouver. You should just take a walk in the area where you would like to live and look for rental advertisements. If you&rsquo;re a lucky one you may even come across aprt options not listed on websites. <u>Don&rsquo;t underestimate street advertising</u>.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong>Ad Analysis</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>I know that everything depends on your own preferences and vision of your future home-of-dream. But when looking through advertisements it&rsquo;s important to pay attention to some crucial things.</p>
<ul>
<li>Price Vs Location</li>
</ul>
<p>You can calculate whether it&rsquo;s reasonable to choose aprt in downtown near your office or to pay less but spend more time commuting by public transport or car.</p>
<ul>
<li>Location</li>
</ul>
<p>Search with Google maps if there are any groceries/ skytrain stations/ bus stops/ parks near your house. Also make sure that you&rsquo;ll not live near an active construction with all variety of building noise or near a highway (with the same noisy problem). If it&rsquo;s, all in all, downtown &ndash; the higher store is better: you&rsquo;ll live too high to hear the buzz of traffic and never-sleeping streets.</p>
<ul>
<li>Furnished/ Unfurnished</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are OK with living in a furnished aprt, go ahead. But in Vancouver you can find yourself in trap &ndash; always ask a landlord or a realtor whether furniture on the aprt&rsquo;s photos is included in the price and if it&rsquo;s owner&rsquo;s or tenant&rsquo;s items. Furnish can be not mentioned in the description of the flat but spotted on the picture &ndash; so, you&rsquo;ll think it goes with the aprt. But not always, buddy.</p>
<ul>
<li>Utilities/ Facilities</li>
</ul>
<p>Kitchen and bathroom appliances are usually included in all apartments but, of course, it depends. So, double-check about laundry/washing (in unit/ building/without), parking lot (included/ for additional fee), gym, pool, rooftop etc.</p>
<p>Then &ndash; utilities. What is included and what are you to pay by yourself (electricity, heater, Internet, cable etc.)? All this stuff will be fixed in a contract &ndash; so you may calculate additional expenses for not covered utilities and consider if an option fits you.</p>
<ul>
<li>Pets</li>
</ul>
<p>It always depends on a building&rsquo;s rules and landlord principles. In some cases &ndash; you&rsquo;re allowed to have only small pets like cats for a pet deposit (to 50% of your month&rsquo;s fee). Sometimes no pets are allowed at all &ndash; so if you have a little fluffy friend, you should think about this matter in advance.</p>
<ul>
<li>Lease Duration</li>
</ul>
<p>Decide for how long you&rsquo;d like to stay in the same apartment and pay attention to preferred lease duration mentioned by an owner. It happens that nice apartments you like will be available only for 1 or 3 months. On the other hand, many landlords look for tenants for 1-year lease. It&rsquo;d be perfect if your expectations coincide.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li><strong>Your Rights and Obligations</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>I have good news. To make the process smooth and painless you should just be aware of the general BC rental rules. This <strong>official website</strong> (https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/housing-tenancy/residential-tenancies) contains all information you may need, answers to the trickiest questions and even samples of contracts and other documents.</p>
<p>Pay attention to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Residential Tenancy Agreement</li>
<li>Fees &amp; Deposits</li>
<li>Condition Inspection</li>
</ul>
<p>Remember: there is <strong>one form</strong> of agreement <strong>required from all tenants and landlords of BC</strong> and it should be <strong>up-to-date</strong>. Don&rsquo;t let a dishonest landlord take advantage of you. If you control the situation and obey laws then, in the case of dispute, <strong>you&rsquo;ll be able to prove your rightness</strong>. &nbsp;</p>
<ol start="5">
<li><strong>Be Active and Polite</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>You want to find a good aprt and a landlord wants to find a good tenant &ndash; this is the usual state of things. There is always a kind of <strong>competition</strong> for nice flats with nice location and affordable price - they&rsquo;re real hotcakes. If you&rsquo;re not willing to miss your boat, try to make a good impression on your potential landlord. I don&rsquo;t mean making friends, telling jokes and paying compliments to everything you see.</p>
<p>Be polite, ask all important questions you have and, if you like an apartment, don&rsquo;t hesitate to fill in an application. Applications for rent usually contain general questions about you, your work, credit and criminal records etc. It&rsquo;s even OK if an owner asks you to give your HR&rsquo;s phone number to make sure you&rsquo;ve provided relevant information. Overall, trustful relationship with a landlord is a must. And a clean conscience too. 😊</p>
<p>I hope now you&rsquo;re not afraid of starting your find-nice-apartment-in-Vancouver challenge. As one landlord has said to us, &ldquo;trust your gut feeling&rdquo; and it&rsquo;ll lead you to your new desirable home.</p>
