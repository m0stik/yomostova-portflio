<h1><strong>How To Survive In A 10-hour Flight </strong></h1>
<p>Our way to Canadian lands was quite long and tiring. Firstly, we had a farewell party with our friends which dragged on to the moment when we had to leave for the airport (in fact, it was 3 am). Then 3-hour flight to transfer in Paris, 1 hour of waiting and, finally, we met our big and paleface Boeing. As fate would have it, our airline was Air France and they successfully delivered us to Vancouver.</p>
<p>All in all, I learned these important truths:</p>
<ol>
<li>First, you should set your mind on positive. Yes, you'll have a long way, and, yes, you can't get out of the plane. But it's all about our frame of mind. Fly with excitement and can-do attitude - that's the right choice.</li>
<li>Dress yourself in comfortable, warm and multi-layer clothes (so, you&rsquo;ll be able to take an item off or put more on you). It may be chilly during a flight. For instance, we were within an ace of being frozen (not literally, but&hellip;). And don&rsquo;t forget about warm and convenient shoes (no high wheels, ladies) &ndash; you&rsquo;ll feel cold in your legs first. Nobody wants to catch a cold, right?</li>
<li>Take care about snacks and water (you can buy it in duty free). It all depends on an airline but, unfortunately, you cannot be sure that you&rsquo;ll get meals you like and enough water onboard. As for me, I always find myself very hungry in-flight and I don&rsquo;t know the reason for it, but in this situation, I really appreciate every snack I&rsquo;ve taken with me.</li>
<li>Take your favorite devices (laptops, notepads) with your favorite TV series on it. A long flight is a good opportunity to watch a new season of Peaky Blinders, finish the longest book you have and enjoy your best rock music playlists (don&rsquo;t forget about earphones then).</li>
<li>Remember to take any moisturizer, hydrating cream or thermal water. Before my first intercontinental flight I didn&rsquo;t believe in all those tales about dry skin, dry hands and everything. But - unhappily for me &ndash; it&rsquo;s absolute truth. Think about it in advance so you&rsquo;ll not have unwelcome consequences.</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t force yourself to stay awake in the night before a flight if you are planning to sleep on board. Because of our favored friends we didn&rsquo;t sleep even an hour before the travel. But we are not the best example to follow. My advice &ndash; not stress your body yet more &ndash; it will be properly stressed during the long flight and jetlag afterwards. So just take sleeping mask and travel neck cushion to feel more relaxed.</li>
</ol>
<p>That&rsquo;s it. My husband is a long-flight veteran but I&rsquo;m not. I couldn&rsquo;t believe in what was going on and where I was flying. From time to time I opened a virtual map of our travel and observed our plane passing Europe, Greenland and approaching Canada. And then I came up with a thought that such long distances are now covered just in 10 hours. It is so cool to live at the time when different time zones, continents and thousands of miles do not prevent us from exploring the world, meanwhile communicating with our family and friends over oceans. If you still feel insecure of having a flight, do not let bad thoughts into your mind. Just think about all impressions and discoveries you&rsquo;ll have &ndash; it&rsquo;s worth it!</p>
